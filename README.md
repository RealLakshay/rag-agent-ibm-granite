# RAG Agent IBM Assistant

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI assistant tailored to IBM-specific data or use cases. It leverages the power of language models combined with external document retrieval to provide more accurate, grounded, and up-to-date responses.

## 🔍 Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines a retriever module with a generator module to answer queries more effectively by consulting external documents or knowledge bases.

This notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and embedding custom data.
- Performing semantic search over that data.
- Using a language model (e.g., from OpenAI or HuggingFace) to generate contextually aware answers based on relevant retrieved chunks.
- Optional: Integration with IBM data sources or services.

## 🚀 Features

- Vector-based document retrieval using embeddings.
- Chunking and preprocessing of documents for optimized retrieval.
- Query answering pipeline using retrieved context and LLM.
- Customizable for specific domains or datasets.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- LangChain
- FAISS (or similar) for vector storage
- OpenAI / HuggingFace models
- Jupyter Notebook for prototyping
- (Optional) IBM Watson, IBM Cloud resources
